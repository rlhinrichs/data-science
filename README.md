Data tells a story. By learning its story mathematically, we can infer how new data points would likely fit into the equation given similar meaningful relationships, were the story to continue. Machine Learning gives us methods to ingest and interpret the data so we can make predictions.  

Understanding how to successfully tell that story is nuanced- given small datasets, imbalanced classes, sparse data, categorical versus continuous data points, to name a few- there's never a "one-size-fits-all" approach. It's a science to be sure, and a little bit of an art.  

These projects represent highlights of my undergraduate career in Data Science. Please expect errors & messiness along the way. Currently, I've only included Python projects. 
For more discussions regarding many of these and more, please refer to [my website](https://hinrichs.engineering/portfolio).

# Statistical & Machine Learning (Series) SPRING 2023
Investigations of what kinds of problems these principal Python libraries were born to solve. Additionally, we learn how to counteract model overfitting to allow better generalization, and how to address the variance-bias tradeoff algorithmically (<i>y = mx + b</i> where <i>b</i> is bias and <i>m</i> are calculated weights).

# Data Mining (Big Data) FALL 2022
Explorations of how to ingest, wrangle, transform, and interpret large data sets for meaningful extraction and interpretation. Most of the data we used in these projects were anonymous medical records for research, providing excellent real-world examples of optimization tools and techniques.
